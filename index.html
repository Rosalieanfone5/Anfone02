           <h2>BTS members were first discovered in 2010 by their current management company Big Hit Entertainment, <br>
           	   a South Korean entertainment company.<br>
               Entertainment companies like Big Hit have a few different ways to recruit talent whether it's online or in real life, <br>
               according to a recent <br>Harvard Business School case study that analyzed the global success of BTS.<br>
               For example, BTS member Suga was discovered through an online audition in the fall of 2010 <br>
               while Jungkook told a Korean talk show that he was   <br>
               discovered by talent agencies after auditioning for "Superstar K," a Korean show similar to "American Idol." </h2>

           <h2>After being discovered, the new recruits become trainees who received coaching to prepare them to be superstars. <br>
           	This includes dancing and singing lessons as well as acting and media training. <br>

           "Think of it like college," Bang Si-Hyuk, the founder and Co-CEO of Big Hit, said in the HBS case study. <br>

            Many of these trainees are young teenagers between the ages of 13 to 15, according to the study. <br>
            The boy group's youngest member, JungKook, now 22, was 14 when he first started as a trainee for <br>
            Big Hit before debuting a few months before turning 16. <br>
            He shared his journey dating back to his beginnings as a trainee in his single <br>
            "My Time" that was released in BTS' album "Map of the Soul: 7" this past February.</h2>
